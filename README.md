## ✋ <span style="color:#9DB7FF">Mandatory steps</span>

### 1. Clone the project 🌐

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ChildMindInstitute/mindlogger-backend-refactor.git
```

### 2. Setup environment variables ⚙️

👉 Project is configured via environment variables. You have to export them into your session from which you are running the application locally of via Docker.

👉 All default variables configured for making easy to run application via Docker in a few clicks

> 💡 All of them you can find in `.env.default`


#### 2.1 Description 📜
| Key | Default value                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

##### ✋ Mandatory:

> You can see that some environment variables have double underscore (`__`) instead of `_`.
>
> As far as `pydantic` supports [nested settings models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/) it uses to have cleaner code

#### 2.2 Create `.env` file for future needs

It is hightly recommended to create `.env` file as far as it is needed for setting up the project with Local and Docker approaches.

```bash
# Development environment
cp .env.default .env.dev

# Testing environment
cp .env.default .env.testing
```


</br>


## 👨‍🦯 <span style="color:#9DB7FF">Local development</span>

### 1. Decide how would you run storages 🤔

#### 1.1 Setup locally

✅ [🐧 Linux](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/)

✅ [ MacOs](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-mac-os/)


#### 1.2 Install via Docker 🐳

```bash
docker-compose up -d redis
```

### 2. Install all project dependencies 🧱

Pipenv used as a default dependencies manager

```bash
# Activate your environment
pipenv shell

# Install all deps from Pipfile.lock
pipenv sync --dev
```

</br>

> 🛑 **NOTE:** if you don't use `pipenv` for some reason remember that you will not have automatically exported variables from your `.env` file.
>
> 🔗 [Pipenv docs](https://docs.pipenv.org/advanced/#automatic-loading-of-env)

So then you have to do it by your own manually
```bash
# Manual exporting in Unix (like this)
export PYTHONPATH=src/
export BASIC_AUTH__PASSWORD=1234
...
```

...or using a Bash-script
```bash
set -o allexport; source .env; set +o allexport
```

</br>


### 3. Provide code quality ✨

#### 3.1 Using pre-commit hooks 🔬

It is a good practice to use Git hooks to provide better commits.

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` is placed in the root of the repository.

👉 Add this rule to the Git hooks. Just do it

```bash
pre-commit install
```

👉 Then all your staged cahnges will be checked via git hooks on every `git commit`

#### 3.2 Using Makefile 🤖

### 4. Running the application ▶️


> 🛑 **NOTE:** Don't forget to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

In project we use simplified version of imports: `from apps.application_name import class_name, function_name, module_nanme`.

For doing this we must have `src/` folder specified in a **PATH**.

P.S. You don't need to do this additional step if you run application via Docker container 🤫


```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --proxy-headers --port {PORT} --reload
```


</br>
</br>

## 🐳 <span style="color:#9DB7FF">Docker development</span>

### 1. Build application images 🔨

```bash
docker-compose build
```
✅ Make sure that you completed `.env` file. It is using by default in `docker-compose.yaml` file for buildnig.

✅ Check building with `docker images` command. You should see the record with `fastapi_service`.

💡 If you would like to debug the application insode Docker comtainer make sure that you use `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.dev.yaml` in `.env`. It has opened stdin and tty.



### 2. Running the application ▶️

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Additional `docker-compose up` flags that might be useful for development

```bash
-d  # Run docker containers as deamons (in background)
--no-recreate  # If containers already exist, don't recreate them
```

#### Stop the application 🛑
```bash
docker-compose down
```

Additional `docker-compose down` flags that might be useful for development

```bash
-v  # Remove with all volumes
```


### 3. Provide code quality ✨

✋ Only in case you want to setup the Git hooks inside your Docker container and burn down in hell you may skip this step. 👹 🔥

👉 <u>For the rest of audience it is recommended:</u>
1. Don't install pre-commit hooks
2. Use Makefile to run all commands in Docker container


Usage:

```bash
# Run the application in a background
# NOTE: Mandatory to run commands inside the container
docker-compose up -d

# Check the code quality
make dcq

# Check tests passing
make dtest

# Check everything in one hop
make dcheck
```


## 💼 <span style="color:#9DB7FF">Additional</span>

### Makefile

You can use the `Makefile` to work with project (run the application / code quality tools / tests ...)

For local usage:

```bash
# Run the application
make run

# Check the code quality
# make cq

# Check tests passing
make test

# Check everything in one hop
make check

...
```

## <span style="color:#9DB7FF">Alembic (migration)</span>

### 1. Add a new migrations file 🔨

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add a new field"
```

### 2. Upgrade to the latest migration 🔨

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. Downgrade to the specific one 🔨

```bash
alembic downgrade 0e43c346b90d
```
✅ This hash is taken from the generated file in the migrations folder

### 3. Downgrade to the specific one 🔨

```bash
alembic downgrade 0e43c346b90d
```

### 4. Removing the migration 🔨

💡 Do not forget that alembic saves the migration version into the database.
```bash
delete from alembic_version;
```
